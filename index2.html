       <h1>GIT AND GIT COMMANDS</h1>
<p>Git is a version control the state of the system that helps us to track various versions of our code. It does this by creating various snapshots of the state of the codes when we commit them.</p>
<p>There are various commands in git with different functions that enables us to use git effectively and efficiently. Some of which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git  init</li>
<li>Git add .</li>
<li>Git commit –m “commit message”</li>
<li>Git log</li>
<li>Git status</li>
<li>Git remote add remote_repo</li>
<li>Git push</li>
<li>Git rm –r file_name</li>
<li>Git checkout master</li>
<li>Git checkout –D “branch_name”</li>
<li>Git branch master</li>
<li>Git push origin master</li>
<li>Git merge master</li>
<li>Git remote –v</li>
<li>Git alias</li>
<li>Git config global</li>
</ul>
 
<p>I think starting off of the favourite for me will be the git init. This is because without a git initialization in our folder, we won’t be able to carry out any git command required. With git initialization, we are able to do the various commands we require in order for our codes to be logged and tracked.</p>
<p>Also, we have the git add file_name and git commits message commands. Theyenable us to add the various files that we have our codes and a follow up message that indicates what we did to the said files even if new or modified.</p>
<p>We also have the git checkout. This helps us to make changes in our working directory and staging area respectively</p>
<p>The git alias. This helps in writing shortcut to our various git commands in the terminal.</p>
<p>The git remote add, helps us connecting our remote repository to our local repository. With this command, the local repository is informed of the remote repository somewhere where we want to push our codes to.</p>
<p>Most of the git commands are important and favourites depending on what you want to achieve at a particular point in time during your work.</p>
<p>The flags includes m, r, f, </p>
<ul>
    <li>The  “r” flag help us to remove a file from the git 
The “m” this enables us to write our commit message into the git</li>
    <li>The  “f” commands help when we have to remove a file or folder completely. It does this by forcefully removing the contents and its folder</li>
    <li>The “v” flag helps is listing the various versions of our code that we have remotely.</li>
    <li>The "rm" flag helps in removinf file or folder from our directory.</li>li>
</ul>
<h2>The screenshot samples of some of the various git commands:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>The git init, shortened as git i because i have already used the git alias command to make a shortened version of the command to enhance productivity while typing.<br>

    <li><p>The git commit command which helps us indicate that we've indicated a file into the git environment.<br><img src="gitcommit.bmp"> </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The git status. This helps to know the state of files we have in our directory if they untracked or modified. It shows if a file has been worked on or a plain new file. <br><img src="gitstatus.bmp"> </p></li>
    <li><p>The git log command. This show the history log in the git. it shows the number of commits we have made and the commits IDs incase we have to track a particular change. <br><img src="gitlog.bmp"> </p></li>
    <li><p>The git config global: The gives us a list of all the git commands that are in global configuration. <br><img src="gitconfig.bmp"> </p></li>
</ol>
<p>All these commands and many more are useful in order to efficiently and effectively use the git version controls systems.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
